# Lean-O-Matic
Telemetric data for Motorcycle

Based on an Arduino, the purpose of this is to know how much angle you're at in the moment X and how far did you lean since the last start.

Parts used is:
- Arduino Nano
- MMA7361L Accelerometer
- 0.96" 128x64 OLED Display (using SPI)
- 16 LED WS2812 (Also known as NeoPixels by Adafruit)

I'm personally a newbie that just had his motorcycle licence and a few times I was leaning and got kind of scared. I wanted to know if it was because I was quite at an angle or because I'm a noob that don't know what "LEAN" really is.

I do believe it's the second part: I'm a noob.
